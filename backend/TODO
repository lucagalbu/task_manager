- Are the services actually the API?
- The strawberry types must be in the api layer (or the main file) because this is the interface with the external world. Not the services.

- Can't day, start date and end date be combined in only two time stamps? Start_date and End_date?

- GetTask in DAO must not be mocked
- Allow only specific origins in CORS and use not localhost but docker compose host names
